### Introduction
Are you always looking for the chance to get away? Do you enjoy traipsing the globe, but find yourself short on time and energy? It can be quite time-consuming to find plane tickets and lodging. Thatâ€™s why you should book with Travel Tracker!

Travel tracker allows you to see your present, upcoming, past, and present trips at a glance. Once you log in, you can view your traveler dashboard. Travel Tracker displays not only your trips, but also the amount the user has spent on trips this year. The user can also request a new trip by entering their tripâ€™s start date, duration, and location. Once your trip is approved by the Travel Tracker team, it will show in your upcoming trips, and youâ€™ll be on your way!

### Reflection
- The most challenging part of this project was having so much freedom to structure my classes. I struggled with the variety of choices I had at first. However, I tried to keep in mind that I could change my class structures if I decided that I could write them a different way. The original class structure that I had in mind ended up being quite different from the one I have now. I definitely had to push myself to pivot instead of holding onto previous ideas that just werenâ€™t working. This project in particular was a good exercise in looking forward, and not being afraid to change things up in my code.
-  The biggest win that I experienced while writing code for Travel Tracker was when my class structures started to come together and make sense. I feel like working with multiple classes gave me a better idea about what object oriented programming is about. Even though this was a challenge, I think I gained really great insights into why classes and methods are so powerful, and the ways they can work together.


### Future Features

- User can remove or edit upcoming or pending trips in case their plans change.
- User can add photos to their past trips, and view their trip notes when they click the past trip cards.
